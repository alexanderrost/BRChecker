# BRChecker
A World Of Warcraft addon made to alert people to your battleres ability is on cooldown.

If you've ever been tierd of people spamming "br me" or "cr!" in chat while raiding this addon is for you. It scans the chat and alerts your team that your ability is on cooldown, it also tells them the time remaining until it's back up.
